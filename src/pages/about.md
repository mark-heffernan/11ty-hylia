![Me in Sydney](https://res.cloudinary.com/dhiparirq/image/upload/v1656408277/wtc/me_sydney.jpg "Me in Sydney")

Plan A is to walk a stage of the Camino de Santiago this year (2022). I hope to use this blog as a way to record each day’s walking by uploading photos and recording any worthwhile experiences I encounter along the way.

If you would like to get in touch, go old school and email **travel@heffo.biz**. Or send me a DM on Twitter!

I'm currently based in Ireland.
